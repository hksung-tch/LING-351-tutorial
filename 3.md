title: Strings, lists, conditional statement, loops
---

This module includes:
- **Strings** – text manipulation via indexing, slicing, concatenation, and membership tests  
- **Lists** – ordered collections with similar operations to strings  
- **Conditional statements** – branching logic with `if` / `elif` / `else`  
- **Loops** – repeating actions over iterables with `for` and `while`  

---

### 1. Strings

A **string** is a sequence of characters. You can treat it like a list of single-character elements.

#### 1.1 Indexing  
Use square brackets `[]` to retrieve a single character. Indices start at `0`; negative indices count from the end.

```python
sample = "sample"

print(sample[0])    # → 's'   (first character)
print(sample[1])    # → 'a'   (second character)
print(sample[-1])   # → 'e'   (last character)
````

#### 1.2 Slicing

Retrieve a substring by specifying a start and end index: `[start:end]` grabs characters at positions `start` up to (but not including) `end`.

```python
s = "sample"

print(s[0:1])      # → 's'
print(s[0:2])      # → 'sa'
print(s[1:-1])     # → 'ampl'
print(s[1:])       # → 'ample'
print(s[:2])       # → 'sa'
```

#### 1.3 Concatenation

Join strings with the `+` operator:

```python
a = "super"
b = "awesome"

print(a + b)         # → 'superawesome'
print(a + " " + b)   # → 'super awesome'
```

#### 1.4 Membership Test

Use the `in` operator to check if a substring exists:

```python
word = "awesome"

if "a" in word:
    print("Contains 'a'!")   # → Contains 'a'!
else:
    print("No 'a' found.")
```

### 2. Lists

A **list** is an ordered, mutable collection of any Python objects. Lists use square brackets and commas.

```python
platforms = ["Windows", "Mac", "Linux"]
```

#### 2.1 Indexing & Slicing

Lists support the same indexing and slicing rules as strings:

```python
print(platforms[1])    # → 'Mac'
print(platforms[1:])   # → ['Mac', 'Linux']
```

#### 2.2 Concatenation

Combine lists with `+`:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
combined = platforms + numbers
print(combined)
# → ['Windows', 'Mac', 'Linux', 1, 2, 3]
```

#### 2.3 Mutability

* **`.append(x)`** adds an element to the end.
* **`lst[i] = x`** replaces the element at index `i`.

```python
platforms.append("Android")
print(platforms)
# → ['Windows', 'Mac', 'Linux', 'Android']

platforms[0] = "FreeBSD"
print(platforms)
# → ['FreeBSD', 'Mac', 'Linux', 'Android']
```

### 3. Conditional Statements

Branch your code using `if`, `elif`, and `else`. Conditions use comparison or membership operators.

| Operator | Description                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| `==`     | equal to                         |
| `!=`     | not equal to                     |
| `>`      | greater than                     |
| `<`      | less than                        |
| `>=`     | greater than or equal to         |
| `<=`     | less than or equal to            |
| `in`     | element is in sequence/container |

```python
x = 2

if x < 2:
    print("x is less than 2")
elif x == 2:
    print("x is exactly 2")   # → x is exactly 2
else:
    print("x is greater than 2")
```

**Examples with strings & lists**:

```python
# String comparison
s = "python"
if s == "python":
    print("Match!")           # → Match!

# Membership test in list
langs = ["Python", "Java", "C++"]
if "Python" in langs:
    print("Found Python!")   # → Found Python!
```

### 4. Loops

Loops repeat a block of code for each item in an iterable.

#### 4.1 `for` loops

```python
words = ["read", "code", "repeat"]

for w in words:
    print(w)
# → read
# → code
# → repeat
```

You can nest conditionals inside loops:

```python
for w in words:
    if "e" in w:
        print(w)
# → read
# → repeat
```

#### 4.2 `while` loops

```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1
# → 0
# → 1
# → 2
```

### Exercises

1. **String indexing & slicing**

   * Assign `"programming"` to `s`.
   * Print the first character, last character, and substring `"gram"`.

2. **List operations**

   * Create `fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`.
   * Append `"date"`, replace `"banana"` with `"blueberry"`, and print `fruits[1:]`.

3. **Conditional logic**

   * Given `n = 7`, write an `if` block that prints whether `n` is even or odd.

4. **Loop practice**

   * Write a `for` loop over the list `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]` that prints each number divided by 2.

5. **Combined task**

   * Write a function `filter_long_words(words, min_length)` that returns a list of words whose length ≥ `min_length`.
   * Test it on `["data", "analysis", "python", "AI"]` with `min_length=5`.
