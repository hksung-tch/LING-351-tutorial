## LING-351-tutorial

### Intro

In this tutorial, we’ll combine simple Python programming with text data to learn basic skills in text data analysis. By the end, you’ll know how to:

1. Combine code and corpus to achieve basic text analyses.  
2. Automatically extract keywords and phrases that capture style and content.  
3. Use the Python toolset for language processing tasks.
4. Install and run an open-source large language model locally to explore text-understanding tasks.
