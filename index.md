### All-in-one Python tutorial

This tutorial introduces basic Python programming skills through hands-on work with text data. Weâ€™ll begin with the basics of Python, learn how to process and analyze linguistic corpora, and explore key packages used in natural language processing. It is designed for LING 351 (Language Technology and LLMs) and LING 581 (Natural Language Processing I) at RIT, Fall 2025. 

#### Basics
- [Getting started](1.md)
- [Values, variables, functions, methods](2.md)
- [Strings, lists, conditional statement, loops](3.md)
- [Tuples, dictionaries, functions, classes, files](4.md)

#### Text processing
- [Tokenization, lemmatization, frequency calculation](5.md)
- [Concordance](6.md)
- [Collocation](7.md)

#### Packages
- [Numpy](numpy.md)
- [PyTorch](pytorch.md)
