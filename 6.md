### 1. Concordance

- Concordancing is a method in corpus linguistics that involves identifying and displaying occurrences of a target linguistic item (usually a word or phrase) along with its surrounding context.

- It allows researchers to examine how language is used in authentic texts. For example, by seeing how the word "investigate" is used in different contexts, we can understand both its meaning and function in real-world discourse.
